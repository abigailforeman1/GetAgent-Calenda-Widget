# Simple Calendar Widget with React

# Getting started:
`yarn start` to run the development server

# Using the app:
To show the calendar widget click the form or up/down arrows. Use the left/arrows to select the month you want and click on a day. This will store the date and hide the widget. You can also click anywhere on the page to hide the widget.

# What went well:
I haven't worked with Moment.js before so it was really fun learning about that and building something I have never built before from scratch!

# What I would add in the future / with more time:
I would like to fully test the app and improve the mobile version


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
